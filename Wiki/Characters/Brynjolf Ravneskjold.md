## History
### Origins
Coming from a family of great renown and lineage, Brynjolf was always a bit of an outsider. His family had great talent in magic, but Brynjolf never had any ability in the natural magic they seemed so skilled with.

On his 18th birthday he was tired of being left out and alone, so he reached out into the ether and struck a bargain. This has given him the power he wanted to desperately to try and be a true member of his family, but they were even more disgusted he would sink to such lows to achieve this magical ability.

As recompense for his actions he was sent off to England, essentially excommunicated from the family but not the Ravens themselves, as they see he may have a use yet.
