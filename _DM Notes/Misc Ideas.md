## Mythology and Reassigned campaign
- "Reassigned to Antarctica" from a secret order, these fuckups
	- Cotswolds or New Forest maybe? Somewhere semi-remote with roots in mythology, leaning towards the latter
	- Tómmutha => Tonmouth
- Norse-era
	- **Ravens**? Kunnigr?

### Endgame threats
- Annarok (or Tveirrok?), the "second judgment"
	- Ragnarok already occurred, and our world is the result of it
- The Wild Hunt
	- Led by Odin or Loki? Stuck in this role why?
		- Could make Karl's character the offspring of Loki? *Svikaridóttir?*
- Hot evil valkyrie
	- What caused her to shift sides?
	- Wings of steel knives --- a little like Rory from Luci S6

## Mysteries
- William II returns to haunt the New Forest every ~44 years (his estimated age at time of death), making 2023-24 the next occurrence
	- His skull is missing from Winchester Cathedral, perhaps finding and destroying that is the key?
- Look in ToM and see what I can remix
